# image-carousel
Between January and March 2020, I attended <a href="http://www.spiced-academy.com/" target="_blank">SPICED Academy</a>, an intensive 12-week coding program focused on Full Stack JavaScript Web Development in Berlin, Germany. During this program, I built a portfolio of web applications.

This particular project, Image Carousel, was built over the course of 2 days.  I used a combination of Javascript and CSS3 for animations with simple HTML setup.  CSS dictates all the animation classes and Javascript is used to manipulate the DOM and add/remove classes.  Each image stays on the screen for 3 seconds and takes another 3 seconds to get off the screen to the left.  User can also click on dots to be able to jump to an image.  

As bonus features, I added touch events for mobile users and consfigured CSS to be able to display the carousel on mobile devices seamlessly.
